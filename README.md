Hi, I'm @maxbalrog

- ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in physics simulations, neural networks and high-performance computation
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Bayesian Inference and Quantum Field Theory

Research papers:
- [Numerical optimization of quantum vacuum signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03317)
- [Towards high photon density for Compton Scattering by spectral chirp](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12245)
- [Narrow bandwidth gamma comb from nonlinear Compton scattering using the polarization gating technique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12931)
